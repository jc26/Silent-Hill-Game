My 15-112 Fall 2015 term project is a survival game that is based off the game Silent Hill. The horror game starts with the player in one room that has potions, gold, ammo, and doors that lead to other rooms. In each wave, monsters will come out and try to kill the player. The player’s main objective is to survive by maintaining health and sanity while looking for ammo to shoot monsters and gold to build walls.

My program’s programming language is Python 3. The main module it uses is Pygame, which is not pre-installed in python.

The Pygame packages are available for download on the Pygame website:

Other modules that are used include, random, math, and datetime. These are pre-installed in python. 
To run the game, open Game.py in the Source Files and Support Files folder and you run the python file (Ctrl + B on Windows and Command + B on Mac).
